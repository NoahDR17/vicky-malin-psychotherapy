          registered counsellor and psychotherapist, offering one-to-one therapy to adults in the Southport and Formby areas.
          <br />
          I have been working as a psychotherapist since 2022 and opened my private practice in 2023.
          I offer 60-minute sessions at £50, available both in-person and remotely via video or telephone to suit your needs and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choosing a counsellor can feel overwhelming, and I understand how important it is to find someone who feels right for you. To help with this decision, I offer a free, no-obligation 30-minute session. This allows us to meet, discuss your goals, and see if I’m the right fit for you, without any pressure.
