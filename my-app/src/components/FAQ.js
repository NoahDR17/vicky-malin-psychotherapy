              I offer sessions Monday to Saturday flexibly. My day usually starts from 10.00 and may end at 20.00. The first half of the week (Monday to Wednesday) I work from my Southport office, while other days I am available for home visits, online and telephone appointments. Sessions are 60 minutes long and usually take place weekly or fortnightly. Sessions are usually booked on an ongoing basis with regular reviews of progress to make sure they are meeting your needs.

          <Accordion.Body>
            <p>
              No one in the therapy world can agree on this, which can be confusing for people trying to find support. Some people associate counselling with shorter issue-focused work and psychotherapy with longer open-ended personal development work. I use the terms interchangeably and will discuss with you what type of support you are looking for in our initial consultation.

            <p>
              Counselling offers the opportunity to sound off and off-load without judgement. It gives you the chance to explore your thoughts and feelings and to reflect on past troubling events. This process can help you better understand yourself, those around you, and your relationships. We take a step back, 'stand and stare' at your current situation, assess your feelings and decide what (if anything) you wish to change.

            <p>
              Counselling, psychotherapy or therapy can be enlightening and transformative. Our relationships with ourselves and others have the potential to become richer and more authentic. Though counselling can be a challenging process, I am a curious, supportive, and safe practitioner willing to accompany you on your journey. The counselling relationship itself can be therapeutic, providing a secure, trusting, and healthy space.

            <p>
              I believe that a good relationship between therapist and client has a big impact on the effectiveness of therapy. That’s why I offer a free 30 minute initial consultation. This session gives you the opportunity to learn more about how I work and assess if we’re a good fit, as well as for me to understand your needs and determine whether I can support you or recommend a different service.

              The initial 30 minute consultation is free, with sessions thereafter charged at £50 for 60 minutes and £75 for 90 minutes. I also offer a limited number of low-cost places for people on low incomes—please enquire for details. If costs are prohibitive, you might find useful local free or low-cost counselling services at Hub of Hope.

            <p>
              I work as a qualified BACP registered Integrative psychotherapist, employing a relational approach. This means I focus solely on you, help you explore your experiences, and draw on several counselling methods. At the centre of my work is the belief that you are the expert in your life. My role is to listen carefully and help you determine what you want to change or keep, creating a personalized approach that meets your needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I provide a warm, welcoming space for clients of all backgrounds, helping you explore potentially challenging areas at your own pace.

            <p>
              I work integratively and draw from various therapeutic models including:
            </p>

              <li>Person-centred Approach</li>

            <p>
              Counselling is a collaborative process where you speak about whatever is on your mind—no topic is too small. We meet weekly (or fortnightly) for 60‑minute sessions, with ongoing reviews of your progress. I work at a pace you choose, focusing entirely on your needs and experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              The relationship itself can be therapeutic, offering you a secure, trusting space to grow and learn about yourself.
